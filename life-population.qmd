# Life Expectancy vs. Population

In this analysis, I look at how life expectancy in various countries correlates with population (in millions). While I might expect populous countries to show varied life expectancies, there can be significant differences based on factors like healthcare, economic development, and geographic region.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt

gapminder = pd.read_csv("gapminder.csv")

data_2007 = gapminder[gapminder['year'] == 2007]

chart = alt.Chart(data_2007).mark_circle(size=60).encode(
    x='population_millions:Q',
    y='life_expectancy:Q'
).properties(
    width=500,
    height=300,
    title="Life Expectancy vs. Population (2007)"
)
